            I was very excited to jump on to this project as a subcontractor for Sudokrew
            Solutions. They are an amazing JavaScript development house and I knew that I would 
            learn a lot from their codebase. The key feature of this application would calculate your retirement needs 
            based on earnings and savings. Payment for this service was on a subscription basis, which was handled using the Stripe API.

                The Nest Egg Financial Calculator web application was written in JavaScript using Node.js/Express.js, Gulp, Stripe, jQuery and PostgreSQL.
                My responsibilities were to build out a new feature utilizing the Stripe APIâ€™s
                coupons feature. Coupons were administered by the business owner or other admin
                users, which could then be applied to a new or existing subscription.
                The scope of this particular feature spanned across the front and back end of the application
                forcing me to know and understand what tools and modules I was working with in depth. Working with a particular design spec, given to me
                by the in-house designer, allowed me to devise a correct plan of action to complete this feature.
