            I was very excited to jump on to this project as a subcontractor for Sudokrew
            Solutions. They are an amazing JavaScript development house and I knew that I would 
            learn a lot from their codebase. The Nest Egg Financial Calculator web application was 
            written in JavaScript using Node.js/Express.js, Gulp, Stripe, jQuery and PostgreSQL. I 
            reported to the project manager and two in-house developers that had previously worked on 
            this project. The key feature of this application would calculate your retirement needs 
            based on earnings and savings and usage was on a subscription basis using the Stripe API.

          <p>
            My responsibilities were to build out a new feature utilizing the Stripe APIâ€™s
            coupons feature. Coupons were administered by the business owner or other admin
            users, and ultimately applying that coupon discount to a new or existing subscription.
            The scope of this particular feature spanned across the front and back end of the application
            which forced me to know what modules and sections I was working with in depth, as well
            as the Stripe API. Working with a particular spec by the in-house designer gave me
            the correct plan of action to complete this feature.
